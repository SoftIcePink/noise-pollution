<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was built to achieve a few functionnalities :
* Show a list of airports near a position given by the user.
* Show the position of the airports on a map.

Of course, some improvements are to be added.

## Improvements
* Code - Comments modification (delete useless comments, simplify, explicit some code)
* Map - Click to get position (dynamically changes the inputs)
* Map - Show the range perimeter
* Map - Click on Markers show details of the airports
* Data - Cache the data in a file as well as the variable
* Data - Synchronous fetch
* Code - Change variables and function naming
* More to be added, but for now these few points will be my main goals in the next few days.
